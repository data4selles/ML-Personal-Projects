# LebronJames_Points
During this project, we will work with data from the games played by Lebron James, with the aim of creating a model to predict the points he will score in the next game.
For this purpose, I have taken as a reference for the web scraping and analysis the youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne7gxdzjB8I&t=2s) by √Ålvaro Ramos.
